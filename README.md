# To-Do List Application

## Overview

This To-Do List application is a straightforward yet functional web app designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application provides a user-friendly interface for task management, including features to add, edit, mark tasks as in-progress, and delete tasks.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Enter and add new tasks using an input field and an "Add Task" button.
- **Task Management**: Each task item includes options for marking it as "In Progress", editing, or deleting.
- **Dropdown Menu**: Interactive dropdown menu for each task with additional actions.
- **Responsive Design**: Responsive layout for usability across various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides structure and layout for the application.
- **CSS**: Styles the user interface with modern design principles, including flexbox for layout and media queries for responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity, including task management and dropdown functionality.

## How It Works

1. **Task Addition**: Users can enter a task in the input field and click "Add Task" to add it to the list. Tasks are dynamically appended using JavaScript.

2. **Task Options**:
   - **In Progress**: Clicking this option changes the background color of the task to light green, indicating that the task is in progress.
   - **Edit**: Clicking this option prompts the user to edit the task text. If the new text is valid, it updates the task.
   - **Delete**: Clicking this option removes the task from the list.

3. **Dropdown Management**:
   - **Options Button**: Each task features an options button (three dots) that reveals a dropdown menu with additional actions.
   - **Toggle Dropdown**: Clicking the options button toggles the visibility of the dropdown menu for that task.
   - **Close Dropdowns**: Clicking outside of any open dropdown menu will close all dropdowns to ensure only one menu is open at a time.
